##The Personal Portfolio Webpage was built with the primary goal of showcasing a developerâ€™s profile in a professional manner. The website consists of multiple sections such as a welcome banner (hero section), about section, project portfolio, and contact informationâ€”all organized in a single-page layout with smooth navigation.

This project is lightweight, fast, and does not rely on any frameworks or libraries, making it ideal for beginners learning front-end web development or for developers looking to create a minimal portfolio site.
